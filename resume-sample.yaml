Introduction: |
  I fell in love with programming when I started programming with Fortran on Numerical Analysis during my Mathematics degree.
  I decided to focus on programming and databases by taking optional modules in those areas: Visual Basic,
  Management Information Systems (Access), Systems Optimizations (Excel). After a brief adventure in private sector,
  I went back to university to study Computer Science and Engineering and improve my understanding of computing.

  I had the chance to directly help over 50 companies since 1997. My experience mainly includes designing and programming
  bespoke systems. I especially enjoyed working with smaller companies like Bell ICT, where we worked on interesting
  projects and solved real-life business problems with freedom; e.g. CMS, CRM, ERP, e-POS, e-Commerce, accounting and
  payroll systems.

  I like being involved in the entire software development life cycle (SDLC); from the initial stages of R&D and tendering,
  to the final stages of training and support; and all aspects of a solution: full stack. Unlike some developers,
  I do like liaising and negotiating with clients, and developing bespoke applications "tailored" to match their requirements,
  with caution against the possibility of perfectionism and never-ending feature requests. I enjoy working as a team,
  and do not hesitate to mention any issues I see.
